#### Horizontal & Vertical Timeline

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/wvD2-m0FEcE?si=TTqABp_pIONO3_Ut" %}

[**Cool Timeline**](https://cooltimeline.com/plugin/cool-timeline-pro/?utm_source=ctl_plugin\&utm_medium=readme\&utm_campaign=get_pro\&utm_content=top_description) is an advanced WordPress plugin that helps you easily create timelines for your website. You can use it to display your companyâ€™s history, product roadmaps, personal stories, or key events in a vertical layout.

Using Cool Timeline, you can create timeline stories in two ways:

1\. **Gutenberg Timeline Block:** Add and manage timeline stories easily using the built-in block in the WordPress editor. Great for showing steps, events, or roadmaps with a clean design.

2\. **Shortcode-Based Classic Timelines:** Using the classic editor? Just add a simple shortcode to display your timeline on any page or post and customize it the way you like.

### Key Features

* **Timeline Designs:** Display your stories in a stunning vertical timeline or horizontal layout.
* **Gutenberg and Classic Editor Support:** Create timelines easily using the Gutenberg block or a simple shortcode. This works with both new and classic WordPress editors.
* **Smart Shortcode Generator:** Use shortcodes to display timelines anywhere on your site without needing the code.
  *   **Cool Timeline Shortcode:**

      > \[cool-timeline layout="default" skin="default" date-format="F j" icons="YES" show-posts="20" order="DESC" story-content="full"]
* **Works with Page Builders:** Compatible with popular page builders like Gutenberg, WPBakery, and Classic Editor. Elementor and Divi users can also create timelines with additional plugins.
* **ASC/DESC Order:** Arrange your timeline stories in ascending or descending order as needed.
* **Customizable Description:** Choose to show either a summary or the full description for each timeline story, depending on how much detail you want to present.
* **Story Order (ASC / DESC):** Sort your stories in ascending (oldest to newest) or descending (newest to oldest) order based on your timeline.
* **Date Format:** Choose from various date formats to display your timeline stories according to your requirements.
* **Customizable Colors & Fonts:** Change colors, fonts, and styles to fit your brand or website design.
* **Pagination:** Set how many stories you want to display per page to easily manage multiple timelines.
* **Icons or Dots:** Highlight events using custom icons or simple dots to visually distinguish each story on the timeline.
* **Content Alignment:** Align your timeline content left, right, or center to match your websiteâ€™s style and improve readability.
* **Multiple Timelines:** Create and manage several timelines on one site, like company history, product updates, or personal stories.
* **Animation Effects:** Add subtle animations to your timeline items as they appear, making the overall experience more interactive and engaging.
