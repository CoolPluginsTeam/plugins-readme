#### Automatic Translate Addon For Loco Translate

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X\_1RbSVgnOc

**Automatic Translate Addon for Loco Translate** is a WordPress plugin extension that enhances the functionality of the popular **Loco Translate** plugin by adding automatic translation capabilities using third-party machine translation services like Google Translate, DeepL, ChatGPT, Gemini AI, and Chrome Built-in AI, and others.

Loco Translate is primarily a manual translation tool for translating WordPress themes and plugins from within the WordPress admin. However, it doesn’t include built-in support for automatic translations. That’s where our **Automatic Translate Addon** comes in.
