> **Important Notice:** This addon only provides settings to use third-party auto-translation widgets and services (Yandex), it does not provide any translation service. So, we don't guarantee 100% correctness. Please check all translated text carefully before making it live on your production site. If any auto-translate provider stops providing an auto-translation widget or service in the future, in that case, the plugin will not support that translation provider.
