Add Loop Grid Extender to Elementor Loop Grid using dropdowns with post counts. Unlock checkboxes, multilingual filters & advanced options in Pro.\


\== Description ==

**Loop Grid Extender for Elementor Pro** helps you add powerful filter options to Elementor's Loop Grid widget. By default, Loop Grid doesn't let users filter posts or products easily, that's where this addon comes in. It lets you add dropdown filters, show how many posts or products are in each category, and even hide terms you don't want to show.&#x20;

If you use ACF Pro, you can also display content from Repeater fields inside your Loop Grid without any custom code. This makes it perfect for building product grids, blog lists, directories, or event listings where users can quickly filter and find what they need. With this powerful plugin, you can easily build advanced layouts without any extra tools or complex setup.
